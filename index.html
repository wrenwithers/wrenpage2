        <div id="pfont"><p>Hello, my name is Wren, and I'm the owner and designer of 9 for 9. While I'm based in Portland, Oregon, my clients come from all over the world, and working remotely is a specialty of mine.</p>

        <p>I offer a bajillion services, including initial exploration and development for those nervously beginning their first project (Hey! Yes, you! Don't worry, we can get through this SO simply. I'll walk you through every step.) as well as those looking for a total site or brand transmogrification - and everything in between.</p>

        <p> We also offer special design services to non-profits working in human services. UI (that's User Interface, the way people interact with a web site) is especially important for people who may have reduced access to the internet, or reduced ability to utilize it, and requires special considerations that many designers may be unaware of.</p>
